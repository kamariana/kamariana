I'm A Kamariana.

A Human-Centric Teacher and Design Engineer;

Blending a background in history and computer science, my work fits under the umbrellas of teaching, product design, and front-end software engineering â€” and generally thinking about humans first.

Deeply interested in faith and technology; God-willing, these are the two important area of my focus for promoting human well-being and creating positive change in the world. Product design and open web technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and various web APIs are my favorite tools to enhance and amplify human efforts.

How can I help?
