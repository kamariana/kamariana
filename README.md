I'm A Kamariana.

A Human-Centric Teacher and Design Engineer;

Blending a background in product design, history, and computer science, my work fits under the umbrella of teaching, UX research, UI design, and front-end software engineering â€” and generally thinking about humans first.

Deeply interested in faith and technology; God-willing, these are the two important area of my focus for promoting human well-being and creating positive change in the world. Faith and open web technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and various web APIs are my favorite tools to enhance and amplify human efforts.

How can I help?
