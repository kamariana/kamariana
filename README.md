# Peace and blessings! ðŸ‘‹

I'm A Kamariana.

I'm deeply interested in faith and technology. These two are my important area of focus for promoting human well-being and  creating positive change in the world. Quran, Hadith, and open web  technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and various web APIs are my  favorite tools to enhance and amplify human efforts.

I'm a Human-Centric Teacher and Design Engineer; Blending a background in Islam, history, and computer  science, my work fits under the umbrella of teaching, UX research, UI  design, and front-end engineering â€” and generally thinking about humans  first.

I'm not perfect; but I try to do everything with beauty and excellence (al-ihsaan) and trusting God with the results.
